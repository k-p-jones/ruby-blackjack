# ruby-blackjack

This is my implimentation of a command line blackjack game. 
Comments and improvements welcome. 

## Getting started
Download the folder, navigate into it on the command line and run:

        ruby game.rb

Both the player and the dealer start with a bankroll of £1000. The game is over when the player or the dealer run out of money.

Enjoy. 

# To Do
 * Add options to have the ace either high or low
 * Refactor, there is a lot of game logic inside the Game class, tidy up and see if it can be done in a more elegant fashion.
